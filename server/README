On the host side, there is a small program which sits there waiting for
arbitrary commands from the BBC on USB endpoint 4. When one arrives, it is
processed, and a response sent back to the BBC via USB endpoint 2.

Requests look like:

  uint8 channel;
  uint8 command;
  uint8 param1;
  uint8 param2;
  uint16 dataLength;
  uint8 data[dataLength];

...and responses look like:

  uint8 returnCode;
  uint16 dataLength;
  uint8 data[dataLength];

The host side is just a switch statement on the channel and command bytes.
