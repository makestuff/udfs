Since, amazingly enough, Martin Mathers' patched Acorn DFS ROM appears to have
been developed on a BBC Micro, it's not easy to rebuild from source. Also, in
the last 25 years or so I've become lazy to the point where trying to write any
actual code using the BBC Micro's BASIC assembler hurts too much. So I took
Martin's ROM image and knocked up a quick 6502 disassembler which had a bunch
of MMBEEB labels hard-coded into it, so it would generate code that could be
reassembled using the ACME cross-assembler[1]. I then used the output of this
noddy disassembler as the basis for my work on udfs_rom.

# Disassemble SUPERMMC.rom
cd ../mmbeeb
../install/bin/d6502 > SUPERMMC.s

# Install ACME assembler
sudo apt-get install acme

# Use ACME to assemble the output of d6502
acme SUPERMMC.s

# Compare output with the original, verify bitwise-identical
cmp foo.o SUPERMMC.rom
