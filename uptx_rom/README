The UPTX ROM is a sideways ROM written in 6502 assembler which offers a single
OSCLI command: *UPCOMM.

The syntax is:

  *UPCOMM <ch> <cmd> <p1> <p2> <rql> <rqa> <rsa>

Where:

  <ch>: A single byte, giving the channel (should be zero)
  <cmd>: A single byte, giving the command
  <p1> & <p2>: The first and second parameter bytes
  <rql>: The request length in bytes
  <rqa>: The request address
  <rsa>: The response address, or sideways RAM ID

For example, there is a very simple command built into the disk-image server,
which will give the sum, difference, product and quotient of two numbers. You
can call it like this:

  *UPCOMM 00 00 10 02 0000 0000 0900

That will put &12 at &900, &0E at &901, &20 at &902 and &08 at &903. If instead
of &900 you want to write the response to sideways RAM number 4, you can do:

  *UPCOMM 00 00 10 02 0000 0000 R4

The command-line parsing is completely brain-dead, so <ch>, <cmd>, <p1> & <p2>
must all be exactly two hex digits, <rql> & <rqa> must be exactly four hex
digits, and <rsa> must either be exactly four hex digits, or an 'R' followed by
a single hex digit. All fields must be separated by exactly one space character.

The transfer size can be large - you can load a 10KiB image into screen memory
like this:

  $ cd ../xbm2bbc/
  $ make clean; make
    :
  $ lin.x64/rel/xbm2bbc
  src - mary_bits = 10240
  dst - convert = 10240
  $ ls -la out.bin
  -rw-r--r-- 1 chris users 10240 Jan 20 18:32 out.bin
  $ cd ../server/
  $ ln -s ../xbm2bbc/out.bin to_bbc.dat
  $ ../server/lin.x64/rel/server -v 03eb:3002 snapper_v1.ssd

...and on the BBC side:

  10 MODE 4
  20 *UPCOMM 00 02 00 00 0000 0000 5800
