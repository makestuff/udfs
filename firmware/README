Firmware for the Minimus's AT90USB162, using Dean Camera's LUFA library to form
a bridge between the host-side floppy disc "server" and the BBC's User Port.

Basically the firmware just sits there waiting for commands from the BBC. When a
command arrives, it is forwarded to the host on USB endpoint 4, and then waits
for a response from the host on USB endpoint 2, which it forwards on to the BBC.

Notice that there is no specific disc-oriented stuff here; the function of the
firmware is just to send arbitrary commands to the host, and get arbitrary
responses back.
